## What We Do

We aim to bring **systems programming enthusiasts** together by organizing events in Ghent and the surrounding area. Overall, we try to keep the events free and accessible to beginners:

- **Drinks/dinner:** Relax after a long day at work and chat with like-minded people. If you are too exhausted to think, no worries, no-one will judge.
- **Presentations:** Exciting tools and frameworks in programming languages that give a combination of performance and expressiveness. For example, Rust or C++, but other topics are welcome.
- **Workshops:** Moments to hack and learn together on trendy systems software or hardware-related topics. Actual topics will depend on the interests of participants and/or organisers.

## Why the name

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming):

> **Systems programming** aims to produce software and software platforms _which provide services to other software_, are performance constrained, or both.

This is of course a very broad definition, but it includes programming languages such as C, C++, Rust, Zig, and Go, as well as topics like operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems.

## Who We Are

This community was originally a hobby project started by [Willem](https://wvhulle.github.io) in December 2024. Meanwhile, several other passionate people/friends are helping out by organizing events or giving presentations, such as [Hugo Herter](https://github.com/hoh) and [Jo Devriendt](https://jodevriendt.com/contact/).

We are passionate developers. We want to bring together people in the field, who might be isolated from each other, to learn and grow together.
