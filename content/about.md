## What We Are

We are a **local community** for people passionate about performance-conscious and pragmatic programming who want to meet physically in Ghent. This is a platform where members take initiative to organize events focused on systems programming and software engineering topics.

Our events center around encoding ideas in code and making prototypes work in real-life. We view software both as something that serves a purpose and as something that brings peace of mind in its own right.

## What We Do

**Member-driven events** on topics related to software and systems engineering:

- **Social gatherings:** Connect with like-minded developers over drinks or dinner
- **Presentations:** Share knowledge about performance-oriented tools, languages (Rust, C++, Zig, Go), and frameworks
- **Workshops:** Collaborate on systems software, embedded systems, or hardware-related projects

All events are organized by community members. Most are free, some may have small fees to cover costs. **No events generate profit for individuals or groups within the community.**

## Membership

This is a **physical meetup community** for the Ghent area. We welcome software engineers and systems programmers who can attend in-person events. Anonymous internet participation is not supported.

The easiest way to join, is to install the Signal messaging app (mobile/desktop) and join the Signal group chat (link above).

## Why The Name

According to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming):

> **Systems programming** aims to produce software and software platforms _which provide services to other software_, are performance constrained, or both.

This is of course a very broad definition, but it includes programming languages such as C, C++, Rust, Zig, and Go, as well as topics like operating systems, compilers, and embedded systems.
