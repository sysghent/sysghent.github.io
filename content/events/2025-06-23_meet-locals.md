On this event you can catch up with colleagues in the systems programming field from around Ghent and maybe make some new friends.

Topics that could be discussed: compilers, embedded, Rust, C++, high-performance, back-end programming and so on.

As usual, we will meet at the Marengo bar/restaurant. You can find us on one of the tables inside.
