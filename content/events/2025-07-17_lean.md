## Contents

We will try to solve some interesting puzzles using [Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html). The puzzles will be chosen based on the participants' interests and skill levels. The puzzles will be inspired by popular mathematical riddles.

You can find some examples of easier, step-wise Lean puzzles in a collection by [Heinrich Heine University DÃ¼sseldorf](https://adam.math.hhu.de/).

## Target audience

This workshop is suitable for everyone who:

- is not afraid of theorem proving,
- knows at least one programming language,
- loves mathematical or logical puzzles.

You can prepare by reading the [Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/) book.

## Price

The workshop and presentation itself is free.

Use the link to the Signal chat if you want to join dinner around Vrijdagmarkt before the workshop (optional).

## How to find us

Previously, there was a workshop right at the entrance. This time we got another room in the back, called Balkonzaal. Not sure yet, but it might be the first floor.

You can find details about the room at [Balkonzaal](https://zalenzoeker.stad.gent/zalen/fbb665eb-8877-443b-ad2d-e52674635498).
