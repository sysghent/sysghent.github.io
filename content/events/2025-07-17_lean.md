## Contents

Plan:

- Introduction to the mathematical proof assistant and programming language [Lean4](https://leanprover-community.github.io/learn.html). It can be used to implement software, but is currently very popular for formalizing mathematics.
- Introduction Mathlib, the standard library for Lean. It contains a lot of useful definitions and theorems from mathematics, which you can use to solve problems.
- Practice Lean by solving and analyzing riddles, which will be posted on [GitHub](https://github.com/wvhulle/riddle-proofs).



## Price

The workshop and presentation itself is free.

Use the link to the Signal chat if you want to join dinner around Vrijdagmarkt before the workshop (optional).

## How to find us

Previously, on this page, another workshop took place at the groundfloor. This time we got another room in the back, called Balkonzaal. Not sure yet, but it might be the first floor.

You can find details about the room at [Balkonzaal](https://zalenzoeker.stad.gent/zalen/fbb665eb-8877-443b-ad2d-e52674635498).
