We will explore how to use the ground-breaking [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) to solve complex logical and mathematical puzzles.

## Requirements

This workshop is suitable for everyone who:

- had a basic course on theorem proving,
- knows at least one programming language,
- loves mathematical or logical puzzles.

## What to expect

We will try to solve some interesting puzzles using Lean. The puzzles will be chosen based on the participants' interests and skill levels.

For a preview of Lean, see  the proof of [infinitude of primes](https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/7deb334c5f5104f4edad1a6396dd02a8cddefb86/Mathlib/Data/Nat/Prime/Infinite.lean#L27-L38):

```txt
theorem exists_infinite_primes (n : ℕ) : ∃ p, n ≤ p ∧ Prime p :=
  let p := minFac (n ! + 1)
  have f1 : n ! + 1 ≠ 1 := ne_of_gt <| succ_lt_succ <| factorial_pos _
  have pp : Prime p := minFac_prime f1
  have np : n ≤ p :=
    le_of_not_ge fun h =>
      have h₁ : p ∣ n ! := dvd_factorial (minFac_pos _) h
      have h₂ : p ∣ 1 := (Nat.dvd_add_iff_right h₁).2 (minFac_dvd _)
      pp.not_dvd_one h₂
  ⟨p, np, pp⟩
```

Don't worry, we will start with simple examples.

## Details

The workshop and presentation itself is free.

You can find details about the room at [Balkonzaal](https://zalenzoeker.stad.gent/zalen/fbb665eb-8877-443b-ad2d-e52674635498).

We plan to have dinner before the workshop together nearby around Vrijdagmarkt, Ghent. Let us know (using the Signal chat) if you want to join.
