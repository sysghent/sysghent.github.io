We will explore how to use the [Lean theorem prover](https://leanprover-community.github.io/) to solve complex logical and mathematical puzzles. This workshop is suitable for both beginners and those with some experience in theorem proving.

The workshop will take place inside the room [Balkonzaal](https://zalenzoeker.stad.gent/zalen/fbb665eb-8877-443b-ad2d-e52674635498).

There is place for 20 people.
