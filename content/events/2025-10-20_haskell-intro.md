## What You'll Learn

Join us for an introduction to Haskell, the purely functional programming language that has influenced many modern languages and programming concepts.

### Program:

- **Introduction to Functional Programming**: Understanding the functional paradigm and how it differs from imperative programming
- **Haskell Basics**: Syntax, types, and functions - the building blocks of Haskell
- **Immutability and Pure Functions**: Why side effects matter and how Haskell handles them
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions as first-class citizens and common functional patterns
- **Pattern Matching**: One of Haskell's most powerful features for working with data
- **Type System**: Understanding Haskell's strong static type system and type inference
- **Hands-on Practice**: Simple exercises to get you started with writing Haskell code

## Who Should Attend

This workshop is perfect for:
- Systems programmers curious about functional programming
- Developers wanting to expand their programming paradigm knowledge
- Anyone interested in learning a language that emphasizes mathematical elegance and correctness

No prior Haskell experience required, but basic programming knowledge is helpful.

## What to Bring

- Laptop with Haskell installed (GHC/GHCi), or we can help you set it up
- Curiosity about functional programming concepts
- Questions about how functional programming might apply to your work

## Price

The workshop is free. Join us for optional dinner at 18:00 at a nearby restaurant (location TBA).

## How to Find Us

The workshop takes place at Kammerstraat 10 in Ghent. Look for the SysGhent signs to find the right room.
