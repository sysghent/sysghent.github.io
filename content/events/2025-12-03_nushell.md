(Presented by [Willem Vanhulle](willemvanhulle.tech).)

[NuShell](nushell.sh) is a fairly new type of shell focused on *functional structured data processing*. It **fixes most problems of the traditional POSIX shellls** and takes inspiration from PowerShell and real programming languages.

Willem has been a daily user of Nu shell for almost a year and would like to share with you how it can improve your efficiency as a script user, scientist, engineer or developer. Nu shell allows you to process all kinds of data in clean pipelines and build easy to maintain scripts.

The plan for this evening is:

- 19:30: interactive presentation about nu
- 20:30: practice session

You can find more information about the language at [nushell.sh](nushell.sh). Recently, Willem also released a linter for Nu to help you get started: [nu-lint](https://github.com/wvhulle/nu-lint)
