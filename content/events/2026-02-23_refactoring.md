Recent advancements in industry made refactoring incredibly boring, expensive and slow. (_Think about the sound a donkey makes but then reversed._)

[Willem Vanhulle](https://willemvanhulle.tech) will show how to make refactoring great again with a tool [AST-Grep](https://ast-grep.github.io/). This tool can be used to apply extremely targeted and efficient refactors to large codebases in milliseconds.

A sample from the official website:

```bash
ast-grep -p '$A && $A()' -r '$A?.()'
```

The presentation (of 30 minutes.) will not be too technical, so people are able to follow along after a long workday without having a laptop in front of them.

Afterward, let's have a drink in the area!
