    <h2>What We Do</h2>
    <p>We aim to bring <strong>systems programming enthusiasts</strong> together by organizing events in
        Ghent and the surrounding area.
    </p>

    <p>A systems programmer is someone who does systems programming. According to <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_programming">Wikipedia</a>:
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        <strong>Systems programming</strong> aims to produce software and software platforms which
        provide services
        to other software, are performance constrained, or both.
    </blockquote>



    <p>We will organize informal gatherings like:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Drinks/dinner:</strong> relax after a long day at work and chat with like-minded
            people. If you are too exhausted to think, no worries, no-one will judge. The primary
            location will be cafe/restaurant Marengo next to Coupure in Ghent. Please inform the
            organizer if you would like to eat as well.</li>
        <li><strong>Presentations:</strong> exciting tools and frameworks in programming languages that
            give a combination of performance and expressiveness. For example, Rust or C++, but other
            topics are welcome. </li>
        <li><strong>Workshops:</strong> moments to hack and learn together (preceded by a short
            introduction).</li>
    </ul>





    <h2>Why We Do It</h2>
    <p>We are passionate about what we do but we also want to relax a bit, make
        deep connections in-person and have good conversations about systems programming or life in
        general.</p>

    <h2>Who We Are</h2>
    <p>This community was started by a mathematician, <a href="https://wvhulle.github.io">Willem</a>. Meanwhile, a
        biologist <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/herter">Hugo</a> has joined and
        organised a
        workshop.</p>

    <p>Here are some things you could help with:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Searching locations for hosting presentations.</li>
        <li>Picking topics and giving presentations.</li>
        <li>Creating practical workshops and exercises.</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>
